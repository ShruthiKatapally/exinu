This text file is the report for Assignment-6.

Include a description of implentation, lessons learned and team contributions.

Implementation :

The code uses the skeleton code provided in the assignment. 
List of files:

include/fs.h : 
Has the structures for inode, filetable, dirent, directory, fsystem.  

shell/xsh_fstest.c
Shell script which parses the command line arguments and checks if they are valid. 
Also calls the file systems calls which are written in fs.c

system/fs.c
Has the functions for fcreate, fopen, fwrite, fread, fseek, fclose.

system/bs.c
Creates the block system space and has the bread and bwrite functions.

Lessons learned : 

No major problems were encountered.  
Invested major time in understading the low level details about the File Systems Implementation.

Through references from the following books helped in reducing the complexity of coding and concepts related to File Systems and Remote File mechansims.
1.Operating Systems Concepts : The XINU Linksys edition
2.Design of Unix Operating System by Bach

Team Contributions :

The task division for the assignment was as follows:

Jagadeesh:
Code and testing of functionality of file create ,file open, file write.
First round of testing.

Shruthi:
Code and testing of functionality of file read, file seeking and file close.
Second round of testing.
